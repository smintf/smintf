# Smint

Hi! I'm just a random person on here. I'm pretty dumb at programming but does it really matter?

My main thing of right now is playing Block Game (also known as "Minecraft") and making pwa's and learning Node (forever).

Feel free to take a look around my profile or crap. If you need to contact me (insert whatever reason), I prefer either Discord (Smint#1661) or Twitter (https://twitter.com/smintf). Otherwise, enjoy my mess of an account ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
